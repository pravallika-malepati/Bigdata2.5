                                                                           Assignment 2.5


1)Cluster:
               The set of loosely coupled or tightly coupled systems  that are connected and work together as a single system is called as a cluster.

Hadoop Cluster:
               1. Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed for storing and analyzing vast amount of unstructured data in a distributed                     computing environment. These clusters run on low cost commodity computers.
               2.Large Hadoop Clusters are arranged in several racks. Network traffic between different nodes in the same rack is much more desirable than                   network traffic across the racks. 


2)components of hadoop 1.x:
A)The major components of Hadoop 1.x are:
 1.HDFS
 2.MapReduce
 HDFS:It is a hadoop distributed file system used for storing very large files.This component is again divided into two .They are:
1.Name Node:
                       Name Node is palced in master Node.It is used to store the meta data  about the data nodes which are also calles as the slave nodes.
2.Data Node:
                    Data Nodes are places in Slave Nodes. It is used to store our Application Actual Data. It stores data in Data Slots of size 64MB by default.

b.MapReduce:
               The mapreduce is used for processing the large data .MapReduce component is again divided into two sub-components:

1.Job Tracker:
                    Job Tracker is used to assign MapReduce Tasks to Task Trackers in the Cluster of Nodes. 
2.Task Tracker:
Task Tracker executes the Tasks which are assigned by Job Tracker and sends the status of those tasks to Job Tracker.
